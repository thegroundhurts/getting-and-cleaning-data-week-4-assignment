The file run_analysis.R uses smartphone accelerometer data from people performing different activities, 
such as walking, sitting, standing, etc.

This data is originally divided into several text files, which the R file loads into memory, 
then combines into a smaller number of dataframes.

The data is them manipulated into a tidy dataset, and labeled more descriptively

Arithmetic means for each person and activity are found, put into a final datframe, and saved as a space-delimited text file

Further details can be found in the run_analysis.R file comments
