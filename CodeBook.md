Variable names in the txt file and other R script outputs have been re-named from the original features_info.txt included with the dataset.
They are as follows:

tBodyAcc-XYZ       =     Time Domain Body Linear Acceleration -XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ    =     Time Domain Gravitational Linear Acceleration -XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ   =     Time Domain Body Linear Acceleration Jerk -XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ      =     Time Domain Body Angular Velocity -XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  =     Time Domain Body Angular Velocity Jerk -XYZ
tBodyAccMag        =     Time Domain Body Linear Acceleration Magnitude
tGravityAccMag     =     Time Domain Gravitational Linear Acceleration Magnitude
tBodyAccJerkMag    =     Time Domain Body Linear Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
tBodyGyroMag       =     Time Domain Body Angular Velocity Magnitude
tBodyGyroJerkMag   =     Time Domain Body Angular Velocity Jerk Magnitude
fBodyAcc-XYZ       =     Frequency Domain Body Linear Acceleration -XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ   =     Frequency Domain Body Linear Acceleration Jerk -XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ      =     Frequency Domain Body Angular Velocity -XYZ
fBodyAccMag        =     Frequency Domain Body Linear Acceleration Magnitude
fBodyAccJerkMag    =     Frequency Domain Body Linear Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
fBodyGyroMag       =     Frequency Domain Body Angular Velocity Magnitude
fBodyGyroJerkMag   =     Frequency Domain Body Angular Velocity Jerk Magnitude

Units of measure are assumed to be SI (metric)

Calculated arithmetic averages are denoted by appending "Mean" to the above variable labels within the datasets. Same for "Standard Deviation"
Test subjects are identified by numbers in the first column, activity types by there obvious descriptor in the second column.
